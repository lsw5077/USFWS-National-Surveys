# USFWS National Surveys
A collection of pre-1991 National Surveys of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

The United States Fish and Wildlife Survey has collected and published data on Americans' hunting, fishing, 
and other outdoor recreation habits since 1955. Editions of the National Survey released after 1990 can be 
found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/fhwar/library/publications.html). Older editions are 
a bit harder to find, so I've deposited my collection here for other users. 

User Beware: the National Survey's methodology changes a lot between editions, so always make sure to read
the methods closely when seeking to use National Survey data. Happy data mining!
